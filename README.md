*Why We Started Building the Dessert Bowl Management Application*

Our friend, the owner of a dessert bowl cart in Kolhapur, facing several challenges when managing his orders. As demand increasing, he began taking pre-orders manually over the phone intead serving on cart, but the process of noting down customer names, mobile numbers, and order details in a physical notebook became time-consuming and exhausting. With limited manpower and a growing number of customers, he had to restrict the number of orders to just 50-60 per day, which sometimes led to frustrated customers being turned away when they couldn’t place an order in time.

Additionally, since orders were only accepted between 5:00 PM and 6:30 PM, many customers were unaware of this time frame and often showed up only to find out that no orders were being accepted ay the moment. This caused unnecessary confusion, disatisfaction and disappointment.

To address these challenges and provide a better experience for both the owner and customers, we decided to build an application. The goal was to automate and streamline the entire order process, from taking customer details to calculating preparation times, and notifying customers when their orders were ready. This application would help manage orders in real-time, reduce manual effort, and ensure that the owner could handle more orders while keeping things organized.

*We wanted to create a solution that would:*

Simplify the process of managing orders for the owner.
Automatically calculate order preparation and pickup times.
Notify customers instantly when their orders are ready for pickup.
Provide an easy-to-use dashboard where the owner could track orders and make adjustments quickly.
Improve customer satisfaction by ensuring everyone knows the order status and pickup time, reducing confusion.
By building this app, I aimed to improve efficiency, allow the owner to manage a higher volume of orders, and create a more seamless and enjoyable experience for customers.
