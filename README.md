# Dessert Bowl Management Application

## **Why We Started Building the Dessert Bowl Management Application**

| **Problem**                                                                                                                                                           | **Solution**                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Our friend, the owner of a dessert bowl cart in Kolhapur, **faced several challenges** when managing his orders. As demand increased, he began taking pre-orders manually over the phone instead of serving directly at the cart. | To address these challenges and provide a better experience for both the owner and customers, we decided to build an application that would automate the order process, calculate preparation times, and notify customers when their orders were ready for pickup. |
| The process of noting down customer names, mobile numbers, and order details in a physical notebook became **time-consuming** and **exhausting**.                     | The app would **simplify** and **automate** these tasks, reducing manual effort, and **increasing** order capacity without compromising quality.                                      |
| With limited manpower and a growing number of customers, he had to restrict the number of orders to just **50-60 per day**, which led to **frustrated customers** being turned away when they couldn’t place an order in time.  | By automating order tracking and providing real-time updates, the app would help **increase** the order volume while keeping the system **organized**. |
| Since orders were only accepted between **5:00 PM and 6:30 PM**, many customers were unaware of this time frame and often showed up to find that no orders were being accepted at the moment. | The app would **inform** customers of the ordering window, preventing confusion and allowing them to place their orders in advance, streamlining the process. |
| This caused unnecessary **confusion**, **dissatisfaction**, and **disappointment**.                                                                                      | With the app, the customer experience would be **improved** by allowing easy order placement and tracking, leading to **higher satisfaction**. |
