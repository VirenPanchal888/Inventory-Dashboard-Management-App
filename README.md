Order Management:

The owner can edit each order with real-time updates on preparation time.
The owner is able to change the order status to "In Progress" or "Ready" directly from the order details page.
The "Set Ready" option can be triggered when the bowl is ready for pickup, and customers are receiving notifications about when to pick up their orders.
Preparation Time Control:

Preparation Time per Bowl is displayed, and the owner can edit this value (e.g., 2 minutes per bowl).
The app calculates the total queue time based on the number of pending orders, ensuring that the owner knows the estimated pickup time for each order.
The Total Queue Time is dynamically updated based on the current number of orders in the queue.
Integration for Communication:

The app also allows the owner to call the customer directly from the app interface by clicking on the customer’s mobile number.
The customer’s number can be opened in either the phone app or other dialing apps like Truecaller for easier access, helping the owner notify the customer directly.
